# alpine.js basic functions demonstrated by using alpine.js. This is also a fun way I've found to practice.

**My goal has been to lose the procrastination streak I've had, as well as making almost anything I code meaningful in more than 1 or 2 ways. As an example, writing this markdown file to learn markdown. While using it to describe the project I am currently in (alpine.js cheatsheet). I am also practicing my typing on a Kinesis 360. It's a wonder I haven't yet thought about learning Dvorak.**

__This, so I'm told is also a way to write in a bold text with markdown.__

And just on the off chance that I was feeling like writing something in italics, which never happens, I *could* use a single asterisk or a single _underscore_ like this. 

Strikethroughs may one day become something I would want to use for some reason, ~~but just this once for now with a double tilde.~~

There are a couple of different lists that we can type here. The first being an unordered list using a single hyphen, plus sign, or asterisk.

<div style="background-color: #F0FFF0; padding: 10px;">
This is a colored box.
</div>

- [x] Task list
- [x] Item 1
- [x] Item 2


- like this
- because it is lacking numbers
    * I suppose this could be considered a sub-category.
    + and this as well.

1. this would be a good time to introduce ordered lists.
2. which start with numbers followed by a decimal and a space.
3. [This is a handy trick](https://www.27pro.com/cheetsheetz/) 
    - These can be nested and intertwined
        1. no one minds.
